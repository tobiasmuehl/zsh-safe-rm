# zsh-safe-rm

ZSH plugin to add [safe-rm] functionality so that `rm` will put files in your OS's trash instead of permanently deleting
them.

## Usage

`rm` is aliased to use [safe-rm], which is a drop-in replacement for `rm` with all the same flags for a seamless transition.

`del` is also aliased to `safe-rm` to help re-habit your muscle memory to a less destructive command. That way, if you are
ever on a system without `safe-rm`, you aren't too confortable with using `rm` as a safe command. `del` is the recommended
way to use `safe-rm`.

As with all zsh commands, if you need to get back to the builtin `rm`, there are options:
```shell
# simply use a leading backslash
\rm -i obliterate_me.txt

# or use 'command' prefix (command is a "zsh precommand modifier")
command rm -i nuke_it_from_orbit.txt

# or make an alias in .zshrc
alias unsafe-rm="command rm -i"
unsafe-rm this_is_really_gonna_hurt.txt
```
